\title{The VBphenoR package}
\description{
VBphenoR is a library and R package for a variational Bayes approach to clinical patient phenotyping using EHR data.
}
\section{Introduction}{

The main goal of the VBphenoR package is to provide a comprehensive variational
Bayes approach to clinical patient phenotyping using Electronic Health Records (EHR)
data.  The phenotyping model is adapted from Hubbard et al (2019). The motivation
for using variational Bayes rather than the gold-standard Monte Carlo Bayes
approach is computational performance.  Monte Carlo is unable to cope with many
EHR clinical studies due to the number of observations and variables. We explain in
more detail in our paper, Buckley et al. (2024).
}

\section{VB Phenotype algorithm}{

The implementation of VBphenoR performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Run a variational Gaussian Mixture Model using EHR-derived patient characteristics
to discover the latent variable \eqn{D_i} indicating the phenotype of interest for
the \eqn{i}th patient. Patient characteristics can be any patient variables typically
found in EHR data e.g.
\itemize{
\item Gender
\item Age
\item Ethnicity (for disease conditions with ethnicity-related increased risk)
\item Physical e.g. BMI for Type 2 Diabetes
\item Clinical codes (diagnosis, observations, specialist visits, etc.)
\item Prescription medications related to the disease condition
\item Biomarkers (usually by laboratory tests)
}
\item Run a variational Regression model using the latent variable \eqn{D_i} derived
in step 1 as an interaction effect to determine the shift in biomarker levels
from baseline for patients with the phenotype versus those without. Appropriately
informative priors are used to set the biomarker baseline.
\item Run a variational Regression model using the latent variable \eqn{D_i} derived
in step 1 as an interaction effect to determine the sensitivity and specificity
of binary indicators for clinical codes, medications and availability of biomarkers
(since biomarker laboratory tests will include a level of missingness).
}

Further details about the model can be found in the package vignette.
